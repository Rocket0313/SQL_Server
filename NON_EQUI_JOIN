A Non-Equi Join is a type of SQL join where the join condition does not use the equality operator (=). 
Instead, it uses other comparison operators such as <, >, <=, >=, <>, or even other conditions that do not involve direct equality.

When to Use Non-Equi Joins:
Range Joins: When you need to match rows based on a range of values.
Complex Matching: When the relationship between the tables isn't simply based on equality but involves other conditions.
Example Scenario: Salary Ranges
Let's say you have two tables: employees and salary_grades.

employees Table:
emp_id	emp_name	salary
101	John	5000
102	Alice	7000
103	Bob	12000
104	Carol	4000


salary_grades Table:
grade	min_salary	max_salary
A	0	5000
B	5001	10000
C	10001	20000
Using a Non-Equi Join
If you want to assign each employee to a salary grade based on their salary, you can use a Non-Equi Join:

sql
Copy code

SELECT e.emp_name, e.salary, s.grade
FROM employees e
JOIN salary_grades s
ON e.salary BETWEEN s.min_salary AND s.max_salary;
